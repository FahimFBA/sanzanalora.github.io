Hi, I am Sanzana Karim Lora, a Computer Science and Engineering Masters student at the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) ](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/), currently supervised by [Prof. Dr. Rifat Shahriyar](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rifat). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Computational Social Science. My current research focuses on cost and compute-efficient solutions for low-resource natural languages.

I have completed my B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST)](http://aust.edu/). Currently, I am working as an Adjunct Lecturer at the same.
